to provide a fault - tolerant , efficient routing method for te ##le ##com ##munication messages

circuit switching
circuit switching is characterized by a fee per unit of connection time
by a fee per unit of information transmitted
circuit switching
a method which pre - all ##oc ##ates dedicated network bandwidth
by a fee per unit of connection time , even when no data is transferred
by a fee per unit of information transmitted , such as characters , packets , or messages
with or without intermediate forward ##ing nodes
as ##ync ##hr ##ono ##us ##ly using first - in , first - out buffer ##ing , but may be forward ##ed according to some scheduling discipline for fair que ##uing
the packets may be delivered according to a multiple access scheme
with or without intermediate forward ##ing nodes
by intermediate network nodes as ##ync ##hr ##ono ##us ##ly using first - in , first - out buffer ##ing , but may be forward ##ed according to some scheduling discipline for fair que ##uing
the packets may be delivered according to a multiple access scheme
the concept of distributed adaptive message block switching
sur ##vi ##vable communications networks
use of a decent ##ral ##ized network with multiple paths between any two points , dividing user messages into message blocks
delivery of these messages by store and forward switching
a general architecture for a large - scale , distributed , sur ##vi ##vable communications network
by store and forward switching
distributed adaptive message block switching
use of a decent ##ral ##ized network with multiple paths between any two points , dividing user messages into message blocks , later called packets
independently developed the same message routing methodology as developed by Bar ##an
packet switching
proposed to build a nationwide network in the UK
use in the AR ##PA ##NE ##T
Donald Davies
packet switching
suggested it for use in the AR ##PA ##NE ##T
each packet includes complete addressing information
individually , sometimes resulting in different paths and out - of - order delivery
Each packet is labeled with a destination address , source address , and port numbers . It may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet
the original message / data is re ##ass ##em ##bled in the correct order , based on the packet sequence number
The packet header can be small , as it only needs to contain this code and any information , such as length , times ##tam ##p , or sequence number
R ##out ##ing a packet requires the node to look up the connection id in a table
a connection id ##ent ##ifier rather than address information and are negotiated between end ##points so that they are delivered in order and with error checking
a setup phase in each involved node before any packet is transferred to establish the parameters of communication
connection - oriented operations . But X . 25 does it at the network layer of the OS ##I Model . Fr ##ame Re ##lay does it at level two , the data link layer
su ##pp ##lanted by the Internet Protocol ( IP ) at the network layer , and the As ##ync ##hr ##ono ##us Transfer Mode ( AT ##M ) and or versions of Multi - Protocol Label S ##witch ##ing
Fr ##ame Re ##lay was used to inter ##con ##nect LA ##N ##s across wide area networks . However , X . 25 and well as Fr ##ame Re ##lay have been su ##pp ##lanted
A typical configuration is to run IP over AT ##M or a version of MP ##LS
1969
Two fundamental differences involved the division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core
In the virtual call system , the network guarantees sequence ##d delivery of data to the host
Use ##r Data ##gram Protocol
a proprietary suite of networking protocols developed by Apple Inc . in 1985
that allowed local area networks to be established ad ho ##c without the requirement for a centralized route ##r or server
automatically assigned addresses , updated the distributed names ##pace , and con ##figured any required inter - network routing
a plug - n - play system
C ##Y ##CL ##AD ##ES packet switching network
to make the hosts responsible for reliable delivery of data , rather than the network itself
using unreliable data ##gram ##s and associated end - to - end protocol mechanisms
later AR ##PA ##NE ##T architecture
a suite of network protocols created by Digital Equipment Corporation
connect two PD ##P - 11 mini ##com ##pute ##rs
Initially built with three layers , it later ( 1982 ) evolved into a seven - layer OS ##I - com ##pliant networking protocol
were open standards with published specifications , and several implementation ##s were developed outside DE ##C , including one for Linux
a data network based on this voice - phone network was designed to connect GE ' s four computer sales and service centers
the world ' s first commercial online service
They lost money from the beginning , and Sin ##back , a high - level marketing manager , was given the job of turning the business around
that a time - sharing system , based on Ke ##m ##ney ' s work at Dartmouth — which used a computer on loan from GE — could be profitable
as a means to help the state ' s educational and economic development
an interactive host to host connection was made between the IBM main ##frame computer systems at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Wayne State
E ##ther ##net attached hosts , and eventually T ##CP / IP and additional public universities in Michigan join the network

an international data communications network headquartered in San Jose , CA
connect host computers ( servers ) at thousands of large companies , educational institutions , and government agencies
connected via dial - up connections or dedicated as ##ync connections
government agencies and large companies ( mostly banks and airlines ) to build their own dedicated networks
private networks were often connected via gateway ##s to the public network to reach locations not on the private network
There were two kinds of X . 25 networks . Some such as D ##AT ##AP ##AC and T ##RA ##NS ##PA ##C
D ##AT ##AP ##AC was developed by Bell Northern Research
A user or host could call a host on a foreign network by including the D ##NI ##C of the remote network as part of the destination address
AU ##ST ##PA ##C was an Australian public X . 25 network operated by Tel ##stra
supporting applications such as on - line betting , financial applications
Access can be via a dial - up terminal to a PA ##D , or , by linking a permanent X . 25 node to the network
was the public switched data network operated by the Dutch PT ##T Telecom
Data ##net 1 only referred to the network and the connected users via leased lines
public PA ##D service Tel ##ep ##ad ( using the D ##NI ##C 204 ##9
use of the name was incorrect all these services were managed by the same people within one department of K ##P ##N contributed to the confusion
The Computer Science Network
to extend networking benefits , for computer science departments at academic and research institutions that could not be directly connected to AR ##PA ##NE ##T
role in spreading awareness of , and access to , national networking and was a major milestone on the path to development of the global Internet
a not - for - profit United States computer networking consortium led by members from the research and education communities , industry , and government
The Internet ##2 community , in partnership with Q ##wes ##t
A ##bil ##ene
a partnership with Level 3 Communications to launch a brand new nationwide network
Internet ##2 officially retired A ##bil ##ene and now refers to its new , higher capacity network as the Internet ##2 Network
The National Science Foundation Network

it developed into a major part of the Internet backbone
The Very high - speed Back ##bone Network Service

to provide a fault - tolerant , efficient routing method for te ##le ##com ##munication messages
Davies is credited with coin ##ing the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching networks in Europe
circuit switching
circuit switching is characterized by a fee per unit of connection time
by a fee per unit of information transmitted
circuit switching
a method which pre - all ##oc ##ates dedicated network bandwidth
by a fee per unit of connection time , even when no data is transferred
by a fee per unit of information transmitted , such as characters , packets , or messages
the packets may be delivered according to a multiple access scheme
with or without intermediate forward ##ing nodes
by intermediate network nodes as ##ync ##hr ##ono ##us ##ly using first - in , first - out buffer ##ing , but may be forward ##ed according to some scheduling discipline for fair que ##uing
the packets may be delivered according to a multiple access scheme
the concept of distributed adaptive message block switching
sur ##vi ##vable communications networks
use of a decent ##ral ##ized network with multiple paths between any two points , dividing user messages into message blocks
delivery of these messages by store and forward switching
distributed adaptive message block switching
a general architecture for a large - scale , distributed , sur ##vi ##vable communications network
use of a decent ##ral ##ized network with multiple paths between any two points , dividing user messages into message blocks , later called packets
by store and forward switching
independently developed the same message routing methodology as developed by Bar ##an
packet switching
proposed to build a nationwide network in the UK
use in the AR ##PA ##NE ##T
Donald Davies
packet switching
suggested it for use in the AR ##PA ##NE ##T
each packet includes complete addressing information
individually , sometimes resulting in different paths and out - of - order delivery
Each packet is labeled with a destination address , source address , and port numbers . It may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet
the original message / data is re ##ass ##em ##bled in the correct order , based on the packet sequence number
a setup phase in each involved node before any packet is transferred to establish the parameters of communication
a connection id ##ent ##ifier rather than address information and are negotiated between end ##points so that they are delivered in order and with error checking
R ##out ##ing a packet requires the node to look up the connection id in a table
The packet header can be small , as it only needs to contain this code and any information , such as length , times ##tam ##p , or sequence number
connection - oriented operations . But X . 25 does it at the network layer of the OS ##I Model . Fr ##ame Re ##lay does it at level two , the data link layer
Fr ##ame Re ##lay was used to inter ##con ##nect LA ##N ##s across wide area networks . However , X . 25 and well as Fr ##ame Re ##lay have been su ##pp ##lanted
su ##pp ##lanted by the Internet Protocol ( IP ) at the network layer , and the As ##ync ##hr ##ono ##us Transfer Mode ( AT ##M ) and or versions of Multi - Protocol Label S ##witch ##ing
A typical configuration is to run IP over AT ##M or a version of MP ##LS
1969
Two fundamental differences involved the division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core
In the virtual call system , the network guarantees sequence ##d delivery of data to the host
Use ##r Data ##gram Protocol
a proprietary suite of networking protocols developed by Apple Inc . in 1985
that allowed local area networks to be established ad ho ##c without the requirement for a centralized route ##r or server

a plug - n - play system
C ##Y ##CL ##AD ##ES packet switching network

Initially built with three layers , it later ( 1982 ) evolved into a seven - layer OS ##I - com ##pliant networking protocol
were open standards with published specifications , and several implementation ##s were developed outside DE ##C , including one for Linux
a data network based on this voice - phone network was designed to connect GE ' s four computer sales and service centers
the world ' s first commercial online service
They lost money from the beginning , and Sin ##back , a high - level marketing manager , was given the job of turning the business around
that a time - sharing system , based on Ke ##m ##ney ' s work at Dartmouth — which used a computer on loan from GE — could be profitable
as a means to help the state ' s educational and economic development

connected via dial - up connections or dedicated as ##ync connections
government agencies and large companies ( mostly banks and airlines ) to build their own dedicated networks
private networks were often connected via gateway ##s to the public network to reach locations not on the private network
There were two kinds of X . 25 networks . Some such as D ##AT ##AP ##AC and T ##RA ##NS ##PA ##C
D ##AT ##AP ##AC was developed by Bell Northern Research
A user or host could call a host on a foreign network by including the D ##NI ##C of the remote network as part of the destination address
AU ##ST ##PA ##C was an Australian public X . 25 network operated by Tel ##stra
supporting applications such as on - line betting , financial applications
Access can be via a dial - up terminal to a PA ##D , or , by linking a permanent X . 25 node to the network
